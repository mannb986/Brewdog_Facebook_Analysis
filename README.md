# Brewdog_Facebook_Analysis

Analysis of Facebook posts by Brewdog on their Facebook page.

Facebook's API Graph was used to download data on posts by Brewdog on their Facebook page, the following fields of data were downloaded and analysed:

* Posts Totals 
* Comments on the post 
* Total likes on the post 
* Post id 
* Message content

The data was cleaned up and I analysed the which posts had the most comments and most likes. I also looked at the most used words used by Brewdog in their posts.
